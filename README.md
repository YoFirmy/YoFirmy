## Background
I started coding in November 2020. I have always enjoyed learning new skills (see the [Hobbies](#hobbies) section) so coding was just another skill to add to my repertoire. After a few months I had already built a basic web application and I realised this was something that I wanted to do full time.
I applied to study with Makers Academy where I not only developed my coding knowledge but also learnt to use good coding practices (see the [Education](#education) section). I have also taken on the role of mentoring two current Makers students so I can share what I've learnt and continue to practice what knowledge I have gained whilst there.

Prior to Makers Academy I was a toy specialist, working in renowned toy stores in London (see [Work Experience](#work-experience) below). I gained a lot of customer service and management skills which I know will continue to serve me in the future.

## Skills
**Languages/tools:** I mainly default to Ruby and the Ruby on Rails framework, but I also feel comfortable writing in plain HTML and love experimenting with CSS to get interesting designs and visuals. I have used a fair amount of JavaScript as well and would like to continue developing my skills with it.

**Leadership:** My last two previous jobs were in management. I feel I did well in those roles because I learnt how to balance the importance of leading by example and also knowing when to delegate.

**Problem solving:** Working in retail management I had to problem solve on a daily basis. In fact I developed this skill long before any work experience as most of my favourite games utilise problem solving. My favourite PC game is a bomb defusal game (Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes). I also solve rubik's cubes, nonograms, codewars and cssbattle challenges. Here is my codewars badge:

**Adaptable:** I have experience in adapting to different situations. For example, in my last job I was a manager of a small circus store in Camden. It ranged from extremely busy on weekends to very quiet (sadly retail struggled through the pandemic) so I've learnt to work well as part of a team or as an individual.

## Projects
| Project | Description | Technologies | Testing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Key-J](https://github.com/JEC1100/key-j) | This was the last group Project I worked on at Makers. It is a web app for finding the musical attributes of a song and then comparing it to other songs. | Node.js, React.js, Express.js | Jest, Puppeteer |
| [Gilded-Rose](https://github.com/YoFirmy/Gilded_Rose_Ruby) | This is my solution to the Gilded Rose Kata. The challenge is to refactor some legacy code and then from there implement a new feature. | Ruby | Rspec |
| [Seddit](https://github.com/YoFirmy/seddit) | A Reddit Clone that I am working on. I am creating purely as a learning exercise | Ruby on Rails | Rspec, Capybara |

## Work experience
**Oddballs** (March 2018 to June 2021)  
_Store Manager_

**Hamleys** (October 2014 to March 2018)  
_Toy Expert_

## Hobbies
**Skateboarding:** Skateboarding has taught me resilience. In order to learn new tricks I constantly have to put myself at risk of injury, and therefore, further outside of my comfort zone. Although skateboarding is a very physical activity, it's biggest challenge is a mental one: Battling with fear, which helps me to better myself in all aspects of life.

**Music:** I love writing and performing music. I specialise with guitar but I have focused enough on music theory that I can pick up most instruments and learn to play something fairly quickly. My love of learning stemmed from music in the first place, seeing musicians on stage and letting it motivate me to do the same.

**Circus:** I love learning new skills. My favorite circus skill is passing clubs; Learning to juggle as a pair (or even a group). It's always fun sharing new tricks and ideas, and there seems like no limit to the possibilities.
